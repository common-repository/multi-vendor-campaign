Earn more money by creating campaigns to allow vendors display their products on specific areas of your store.

== Description ==

The Multi-Vendor Campaign is a necessary add-on for popular multi-vendor plugins that enables ambitious shop owners to reserve top positions of the shop for special products by creating limited-time campaigns. Vendors who are willing to pay an extra commission can join the campaigns and subscribe their products.

As a result, vendors can increase their sales by joining the campaign, and shop owners can earn more commission by featuring subscribed products on their website. Win-win for everyone! We support all popular multi-vendor plugins: **Dokan**, **YITH Multi-Vendor Free & Premium**, **WC Vendors Free & Pro**, and **WC Marketplace**. You can easily download each one you like from the links below:
